# **Day 7 - Live Deployment and Post-Launch Practices**  
**Objective:**  
On Day 7, I focused on the final step of the hackathon by deploying the marketplace to a live production environment. This stage consolidated all the work completed in the previous days to create a fully functional, secure, and customer-ready platform. Additionally, I implemented industry-standard best practices for deployment and post-launch activities such as branding, marketing, and partnerships while emphasizing future scalability and operational readiness.

### **Steps Implemented:**  

1. **Production Deployment:**  
   - **Environment Setup:**  
     - Configured production environment variables securely.  
     - Ensured all sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) was encrypted and stored securely.  

   - **Secure Hosting:**  
     - Deployed the marketplace on Vercel, a reliable hosting platform. [https://hackathon-marketplace-taupe.vercel.app/]
     - Enabled HTTPS for all traffic using SSL certificates.  

   - **Codebase Management:**  
     - Maintained a private production repository for security.  
     - Separated staging and production repositories for better environment management.  
     - Documented every step of the deployment process for future reference.  

2. **Penetration Testing and Security:**  
   - Conducted penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF using tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.  
   - Encrypted sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, payment details) to ensure secure data storage and transmission.  
   - Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) for secure user management.  
   - Scheduled periodic security audits to ensure continued protection.  

3. **Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning:**  
   - Scheduled regular database backups and stored them in secure, multiple locations.  
   - Created a DR plan to restore operations quickly in case of failure and tested its reliability.  

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**  
   - Used monitoring tools like Google Analytics, Sentry, and Pingdom for real-time issue tracking.  
   - Monitored site performance and optimized speed and reliability regularly.  
   - Planned scheduled maintenance to update features while notifying users in advance.
